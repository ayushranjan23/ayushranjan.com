i took the SAT twice before taking the ACT; my performance was really bad both times and i think that it is necessary for me to preface with that because it goes to show that sometimes its not the hard work but the environment that could be a reason for your performance not being like what you expect.

## standardized tests

basically, there are quite a few highschools from an international view and this means that most of them may not necessarily grade in a standardized way; of course, we have curricula like IB, IGCSE, GCSE etc. (i did IB), but there are still nuances in grade prediction and other fundamentals; so a simple way to check people's aptitude is through standardized testing.

## ACT vs SAT

i never really knew that the ACT existed as a form of standardized testing until i had written the SAT twice; i wrote it twice because i did not do well the first time, my university counsellor literally told me to exclude my score in my applications (i had the option to exclude my score since i was mainly applying to canadian schools).

the SAT is a physical exam where you're given a pencil and have to check boxes by shading on them and the ACT is on a computer; there are also differences in the breadth and depth among both the tests but i think you'll be fairly okay if you're in highschool studying science, math and english.

## why the SAT wasn't for me

i struggled with physical paper in highschool; i had an iPad and used that to take notes and do everything on it; in hindsight, i don't think that was the best decision, i'm in university now and i prefer to mix the 2 forms of writing (paper and on iPad/tablet) because my exams are mostly on paper anyway and it's easier to focus on paper since there aren't as many distractions.

to be honest, i never even considered that the medium of the exam would be the problem for me; when i found out about the ACT being on computer, i was surprised because it meant that i wouldn't need to manage multiple booklets, everything was just click and go and that alone took a lot of stress off my shoulders.

## switching to the ACT

after my second SAT attempt, i was pretty discouraged and thought standardized tests just weren't my thing; my counsellor mentioned the ACT as an alternative and i decided to give it a shot without much expectation. i registered for a date a month away and started prepping using online resources (mostly free stuff like Khan Academy and some practice tests i found).

the prep felt different because i could do everything on my laptop, mimicking the actual test environment; i practiced timing a lot since the ACT has more questions per section but the computer format made it super easy for me to track my progress and review my mistakes quickly. i also focused on the science section, which isn't in the SAT; since i did IB science courses, it wasn't too bad.

## taking the ACT and getting my score

test day came and i was nervous but the computer setup felt familiar, like just another study session; the sections went by smoothly, i didn't have any issues with the interface or timing. a few weeks later, when scores were released, i logged in and saw a perfect 36. i didn't really know what to do, i told my parents and they also didn't know what to either lol.

i think the key was the environment; being on computer removed the physical barriers i had with paper, and i could focus more on the questions themselves. it's funny how something as simple as the test medium can make such a big difference.

## what a perfect score means to me

getting a perfect score didn't suddenly make me feel smarter or more capable; it just confirmed that sometimes, you need to find the right fit for your way of doing things. in school, we're often pushed toward one path (like the SAT being more common where i was), but exploring alternatives can lead to better outcomes.

i'm not saying the ACT is easier or harder than the SAT, it's just different, and for me, it worked better. now, when i look back, i realize that performance isn't always about effort alone; factors like comfort with the format, stress management, and even minor details like using a computer vs paper can sway results.

## advice for others

if you're struggling with standardized tests, maybe take a step back and think about why; is it the content, the timing, or the way the test is delivered? for me, switching to the ACT was a game-changer, but it might not be for everyone. try practice tests in both formats if you can, and see what feels more natural. also see if there are other alternatives, who knows?

also, don't let one bad score define you; i had two bad SAT scores and almost gave up (pretty much gave up), but trying a different approach paid off. in the end, these tests are just one part of applications, and finding what works for you can make the process less stressful.

## closing thoughts

so yeah, i got a perfect score on the ACT, and it taught me that adaptability matters more than i thought. sometimes a small change in approach can lead to big improvements. i'm glad i didn't stick to the SAT out of stubbornness, and i hope my experience might help someone else consider their options too.

also no matter happens, i probably don't know you but trust me i'm rooting for you because i know how it feels to try so hard and just not have anything work out, just keep pushing, it'll work, trust me, it will :)

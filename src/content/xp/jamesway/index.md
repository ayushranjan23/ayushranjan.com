## intro
i remember during my interview, my supervisor literally told me "you can do school projects if you want to during work". i didn't really understand why he said that until the first day of real work when i stepped into office and realized that jamesway isn't a software company, they manufacture incubators to hatch chickens. definitely a dream for a mechanical engineer. umm, oops. but ya know what, i had a blast at jamesway and i did so much work, much more than i did in any previous coop and it was all software too hehe.

## why it matters

- Worked closely with product and data teams to validate metrics.
- Wrote integration tests for SQL queries and data transformations.
- Documented data lineage for key business tables.

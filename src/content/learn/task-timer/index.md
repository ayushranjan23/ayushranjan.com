Task Timer is a lightweight web app for tracking focused work. Start a timer, log tasks, and see how much time you spend on different types of work.

- **Quick start**: Type the task name and hit Enter to begin
- **Keyboard-first**: Full control with arrow keys and numbers
- **Simple stats**: Total time per task type across all sessions
- **Dark mode**: Respects system theme preference

## How it works

1. Open the app
2. Type a task name (e.g., "Design", "Code", "Review")
3. Press Enter or click Start—timer begins
4. Work until done
5. Click Stop to log the session
6. View your stats on the dashboard

## Tech stack

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Local storage for persistence
- ~15KB minified and gzipped

## Future ideas

- Export time logs as CSV
- Weekly digest emails
- Pomodoro preset timers
- Integration with calendar to block focus time

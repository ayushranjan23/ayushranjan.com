## intro to grant thornton

if ur into finance, um, bro listen this company is super known in ur area but not that well known in the technical depths;

if ur not into finance, WHAT'S GOOD BUDDY, welcome to this random company i'm working at, totally not a big tech type company in a different industry;

ok i'll be real, gt doesn't need any intro, its a really big firm, i worked in the india office, mostly cuz they're lenient with international kids, i was fully remote either way so yeah, have fun reading :)


## what i did

choose technique to break experience down into smaller parts, try twice as many parts for duration (e.g. 4 months should be 8 parts etc.)
